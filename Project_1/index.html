          <h2>Prime Minister of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b style="margin-left: 50px">Narendra Modi,</b> the Prime Minister
            of India, is a dynamic and influential leader who has left an
            indelible mark on the country's political landscape. Born on
            September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, Gujarat, Modi's journey from a
            humble background to the highest echelons of power is a testament to
            his determination and vision. A member of the Bharatiya Janata Party
            (BJP), Modi rose through the ranks, serving as the Chief Minister of
            Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 before assuming the role of Prime Minister
            in 2014 and securing a second term in 2019. Known for his
            charismatic persona and strong leadership style, Modi has
            implemented various initiatives aimed at economic growth,
            infrastructure development, and social welfare. His ambitious
            projects such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission) and
            Make in India have garnered both praise and criticism, reflecting
            the complexities of governing a nation as diverse as India.
            Additionally, Modi's foreign policy efforts have bolstered India's
            position on the global stage, forging strategic partnerships with
            key countries while navigating regional challenges. However, his
            tenure has also faced scrutiny over issues such as religious
            tensions, economic inequality, and freedom of expression. Despite
            these challenges, Narendra Modi remains a polarizing figure whose
            policies continue to shape India's trajectory on the world stage.
